## Documenting demonstrations, political rallies and polling queues
### Be Prepared
Know your rights before you turn on the camera. Always assess risks to
yourself, interviewees and communities before you film. Develop a
security plan to protect your safety as well as the safety of those you
are filming.

### Verification
Your media is easier to verify if you document the date, time and
location of your footage. If possible, turn on automatic date, time and
GPS location capturing features. Alternately, film newspapers, street
signs or landmarks. Document who is filming by saying your name into the
camera or keeping a written record.

### Film with intention
Hold shots for at least 10 seconds. Keep the camera steady and move it
slowly when changing positions. Avoid jerky movements and zooming. Film
from various angles to show the size of the crowd or the length of the
voting queue. If safe, document incidents of hate speech, confiscation
of communications devices like mobile phones or radios, or the tampering
of ballots.

## Documenting violence and injuries
### Document those affected
When possible, film incidents of voter intimidation, harassment, arrest
or violence. Show if the victims were carrying weapons, wearing uniforms
or acting peacefully. If victims were members of a targeted group, film
identifying details like badges, flags, or stickers.

### Capture details
If safe, get close-up shots of police vehicles, uniforms, badge numbers,
indications of police rank and methods of communication. Capture other
visual records such as bullet holes, tear gas canisters, and who was
involved in the incident. When filming injuries, get close to the body,
ensure good light and hold your shot steady, or take photos.

### Work as a team
If possible, work with a partner or a team to capture multiple angles
of the same incident. A partner can also help keep you safe and
watch for developing situations. If you are at risk of arrest and want
to keep filming, consider giving your used media card to someone
who can guard it and replace it with an empty card.

## Telling the story
### Contextualize with interviews
Get permission from people before you film. Ask consenting individuals
to describe the events taking place or relay their personal experience.
Through their interviews you can expose irregularities in the voter
registration process, the persecution of activists or civil society
groups, stories of sexual or gender based violence, or incidents of
voter intimidation within the community or workplace.

### Protect Identities
Ensure those you film are fully aware of how and where the video will be
used. Discuss potential safety risks if the video is to be shared
publicly, online or with authorities. If anonymity is needed, film
interviewees’ hands while they speak, have the subject wrap their face
in a scarf, or adjust the focus to blur the image.

### Saving and Sharing
Always keep your original media files in a secure location. When sharing your video online, include the
date, time and location in the video’s title and tags. Note additional details and contextualizing links in the
description of the video. This will make your media easier to find and verify.
